# Independent Study on Computer Vision Object Detection

## Overview

This repository contains an independent study focused on computer vision, specifically on object detection techniques. The primary methods explored in this study include:

- **RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)**
- **Fast RCNN**
- **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)**

Each method is implemented and tested in a separate Jupyter notebook, allowing for a standalone execution and easy exploration of the various algorithms.

## Contents

The repository includes the following folders:

- `rcnn`
- `fastrcnn`
- `ssd`

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
